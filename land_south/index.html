            <h2 class='content-subhead'>Update from today (5/2/20) Planning Committee</h2>
            <p>
              Planning committee members were presented with the application for 50 dwellings at St Mary's Church, Church Fenton.  This at reserved matters application gave cause for a good debate.  Councillors shared their concerns about the application, in particular referencing the style, the layout and the special regard that should be placed on this heritage setting.  
</p>

<p>
The committee proposed and voted to refuse this application with recommendation that their ground for refusal are checked and to be confirmed that they are legally correct.
</p>

<p>
As this is a reserved matters application the consideration and decision is taken on layout, scale and external appearance and therefore in our view the refusal is legally correct and binding.

<h2 class='content-subhead'>To our Church Fenton neighbours</h2>
            <p>
Dear Neighbour <br /><br />

We are a group of concerned residents trying to prevent the unjustified granting of planning permission (specifically reserved matters) for the building of 50 houses to the rear of St Maryâ€™s Church/Main Street (planning reference 2017/0736REMM)<br /><br />

As you may be aware we have been fighting against this for the last 5 years and now we are left with 5 days to make our case and stop this from happening.<br /><br />

To this end we would like you to get involved and be active in emailing the planning committee that will determine the future of our village.<br /><br />

The committee will only look at material considerations/material reasons when weighing up their decision to approve the application.<br /><br />

We have provided a number of statements in each section to the left of this website that you can use to object or to email to the committee. It would be helpful if you could edit them to your own words but equally if you are pushed for time just copy and paste at least one statement from each section and press send!<br /><br />

<br />Our intention is to show the committee members how this application is universally disliked and that as a community we will rally against it.<br /><br />

Planning committee meetings are held at 2pm in the Selby District Council, Civic Centre, Selby (adjacent to Selby Hospital). Details <a href='https://democracy.selby.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=135&MId=1651&Ver=4'>here</a>. More villagers attending this meeting will reinforce the message that the village is against this application. If you can please come along and show your objection to this application.<br /><br />
